💼 Portfolio
This repository contains the source code for a practice portfolio website I built while learning web development. The site includes sections for skills, projects, and experiences, created to help me understand how portfolio websites are structured.

⚠️ Note: This website is not fully functional and was created for learning purposes only, not as a final showcase of my work.

🧠 Some parts of the code were generated with the help of AI tools to speed up development and explore different design approaches.
